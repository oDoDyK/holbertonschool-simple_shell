.TH SIMPLE_SHELL 1 "November 2025" "Holberton School" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
.B simple_shell
\- A lightweight command-line interpreter written in C.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B simple_shell
.RI [COMMAND] " [ARGUMENTS]..."
.br
.B ./hsh
.RI [COMMAND] " [OPTIONS]..."

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B simple_shell
project is a simplified UNIX command-line interpreter that mimics the behavior
of the Bourne Shell (sh).  
It allows users to interact directly with the operating system through command execution, built-in functions, and process management.

Developed as part of the Holberton School low-level programming curriculum, this project deepens understanding of key UNIX concepts:
process creation, system calls, environment management, memory allocation, and signal handling.

The shell executes user commands either from standard input (interactive mode) or from a file (non-interactive mode), creating child processes when necessary and supporting core UNIX functionalities.

.SH FEATURES
The shell supports the following core features:
.TP
• Displaying a custom interactive prompt ("🥷 $") when waiting for input.
.TP
• Executing system commands located in directories defined by the PATH environment variable.
.TP
• Managing built-in commands such as
.B cd,
.B env,
.B setenv,
.B unsetenv,
and
.B exit.
.TP
• Handling command chaining using the
.B ;
operator.
.TP
• Supporting logical operators:
.B &&
(for AND)
and
.B ||
(for OR),
executing commands conditionally based on previous success or failure.
.TP
• Implementing a simple
.B alias
system that maps shortcut names to longer commands.
.TP
• Handling user interruptions such as Ctrl+C gracefully, without exiting abruptly.
.TP
• Returning appropriate exit status codes after each command execution.
.TP
• Preventing memory leaks by managing all dynamically allocated resources safely.

.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
The following built-in commands are implemented directly in the shell:

.TP
.B cd [directory]
Change the current working directory.
If no directory is specified, changes to the user's home directory.

.TP
.B exit [status]
Exit the shell.
Optionally, a numeric status code can be provided to specify the exit value.

.TP
.B env
Display the current environment variables.

.TP
.B setenv VARIABLE VALUE
Set or update an environment variable.
If the variable already exists, its value is replaced.

.TP
.B unsetenv VARIABLE
Remove an environment variable.

.TP
.B alias [name[='value'] ...]
Define or display command aliases.
Typing "alias" without arguments prints the list of defined aliases.

.SH OPERATORS
The shell supports command operators for combining commands logically.

.TP
.B ;
Sequential command separator.
All commands separated by ';' are executed in order.

.TP
.B &&
Logical AND operator.
The command following '&&' executes only if the previous command succeeds.

.TP
.B ||
Logical OR operator.
The command following '||' executes only if the previous command fails.

.SH USAGE EXAMPLES
.TP
.B Example 1: Interactive mode
.RS
.nf

.TP
.B Example 3: Logical operators
.RS
.nf
🥷 $ mkdir test && cd test
🥷 $ cd /root || echo "Access denied"
.fi
.RE

.TP
.B Example 4: Using aliases

.SH FILES
The following files are part of the
.B simple_shell
project:

.TP
.B main.c
Entry point of the shell; initializes environment and command loop.

.TP
.B shell_logic.c
Contains the main logic for parsing, executing, and managing commands.

.TP
.B io.c
Handles input/output functions and prompt display.

.TP
.B builtin_cd.c
Implements the "cd" built-in command.

.TP
.B env_builtins.c
Implements the "env", "setenv", and "unsetenv" built-ins.

.TP
.B builtin_alias.c
Implements the "alias" command for managing custom shortcuts.

.TP
.B shell_exit.c

.TP
.B memory.c, vector.c
Utility files for dynamic memory management and buffer handling.

.TP
.B simple_shell.h
Header file containing function prototypes, data structures, and macros.

.SH EXIT STATUS
The shell exits with the status code of the last executed command.
If an error occurs, a non-zero value is returned.
